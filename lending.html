        <h2>THE PAYDAY LOAN TRAP</h2>
        <p>Studies from across the UK expose the financial difficulties among a lot of students and highlights how it
            impacts diet, mental health and replationships. It is easy to see why students regularly turn to solutions such
            as credit cards, pay-day loans, drug trials and 'adult work' throughout the year.</p>
        <p>Payday loans are notorious for their exteremly high interest rates, so much so that many students end up in more debt. Based on a study by Save the Student, I
            estimate around Â£750,000 each year is moved from students account to loan companies via interest. That's a vast
            amount of money from students who are already in debt.</p>
        <p>'Kiwi Lending' is a two-pronged propsal for an alternative platform where students can borrow money with much
            lower interests. Where it differs from pay-day loans is that it will operate as a peer-to-peer service meaning
            not only can students borrow money, they can also loan money to other students through the app.</p>
