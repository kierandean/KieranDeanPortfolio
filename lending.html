            <h3>drink milk?</h3>
            <p>For a very long time, milk was a small part of the lives of a very small number of people. It was used as a
                substitute during cold winters where crops couldn't grow.</p>
            <p> Around the first world war, the US government sent
                vast amounts of canned and powdered milk overseas to fight malnutrition. In response, many farmers in the US
                got
                rid of all livestock and crops apart from cows. As a result, when the US had a huge surplus of milk with no
                demand. By this point farmers and processing plants had invested far too much money into the soon-to-be milk
                industry to stop producing milk.</p>
