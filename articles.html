                <h2>Why do we drink milk?</h2>
                <p>For a very long time, milk was a small part of the lives of a very small number of people. It was used as a
                    substitute during cold winters where crops couldn't grow. Around the first world war, the US government sent
                    vast amounts of canned and powdered milk overseas to fight malnutrition. In response, many farmers in the US got
                    rid of all livestock and crops apart from cows. As a result, when the US had a huge surplus of milk with no
                    demand, by this point farmers and processing plants had invested far too much money into the soon to be milk
                    industry.
                    So, instead of shutting down, they invested in advertising and milk education programs in schools. Soon adverts
                    were plastered all over the US claiming that children should drink 4 glasses of milk a day. Shortly after this,
                    milk was introduced into every school meal.
