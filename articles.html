                <p>For a very long time, milk was a small part of the lives of a very small number of people. It was used as a
                    substitute during cold winters where crops couldn't grow.</p>
                <p> Around the first world war, the US government sent
                    vast amounts of canned and powdered milk overseas to fight malnutrition. In response, many farmers in the US got
                    rid of all livestock and crops apart from cows. As a result, when the US had a huge surplus of milk with no
                    demand. By this point farmers and processing plants had invested far too much money into the soon-to-be milk
                    industry to stop producing milk.</p>

                    <h3>Why is milk such a massive part of culture?</h3>
                <div id="lcolumn">
                    <p>For a very long time, milk was a small part of the lives of a very small number of people. It was
                        used as a substitute during cold winters where crops couldn't grow. Around the first world war, the
                        US government sent vast amounts of canned and powdered milk overseas to fight malnutrition. In
                        response, many farmers in the US got rid of all livestock and crops apart from cows. As a result,
                        when the US had a huge surplus of milk with no demand, by this point farmers and processing plants
                        had invested far too much money into the soon to be milk industry.
                        So, instead of shutting down, they invested in advertising and milk education programs in schools.
                        Soon adverts were plastered all over the US claiming that children should drink 4 glasses of milk a
                        day. Shortly after this, milk was introduced with every school meal.</p>
                    <p>Despite the massive increase in milk consumption due to these campaigns, huge milk supplies still
                        remained in the US. They sent the milk to schools, military and overseas as food aid. By the 1980s
                        the government was spending $2 billion on surplus milk until the Reagan program, in a quest to stop
                        government spending, stopped it. This didn't sit well with dairy farmers who convinced Congress to
                        change the rules and created something called the 'Dairy Checkoff' in which farmers would have to
                        pay into. The Checkoff, in turn, would then fund advertising campaigns for dairy products which were
                        approved by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The 'Got Milk' ads are one example. </p>
                </div>
                <div id="rcolumn">
                    <p> More importantly, this money would pay for partnerships with brands like Starbucks, Dominos,
                        McDonald's, Taco Bell and others. These partnerships would ensure that companies would create
                        dairy-heavy products, like Domino's pizza for example, with 40% more cheese. This means one slice
                        has TWO-THIRDS of the recommended saturated fat.
                        Studies have concluded that the nutritional factors of milk are minuscule compared to nutrition in
                        fruit and vegetables.</p>
                    <p>The USDA is in charge of one of the biggest ad campaigns in the world, aimed at getting people
                        drinking milk. So, if it is known that milk doesn't provide any exceptional vitamins when compared
                        to vegetables, why not change the recommendation? Why not change the guidelines to promote drinking
                        water with every meal?
                        It's the oldest reason in modern civilisation - money. The dairy industry gives millions to
                        politicians to protect their interests.
                        So, next time you grab a cold glass of that chalky brew, think, why do we drink milk?</p>
